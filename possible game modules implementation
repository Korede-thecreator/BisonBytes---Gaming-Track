Random Mole Placement
To implement random mole placement, you might use a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) as a pseudo-random number generator. Here's a simple example of an 8-bit LFSR:

verilog
Copy code
reg [7:0] lfsr = 8'b00000001; // Non-zero initial value

always @(posedge clk) begin
    lfsr <= {lfsr[6:0], lfsr[7] ^ lfsr[5] ^ lfsr[4] ^ lfsr[3]};
end
You can use lfsr's value to determine the mole's position, modulo the screen width and height, ensuring the mole appears in different positions within the display boundaries.

Scoring System and Levels
For scoring and levels, you need registers to keep track of the current score and level, increasing the score when a mole is "whacked" and advancing the level based on certain conditions, like time or score thresholds.

verilog
Copy code
reg [7:0] score = 0;
reg [3:0] level = 1;

// Increase score when the mole is whacked (simplified logic)
always @(posedge btn) begin // Assuming button press indicates a successful whack
    if (btn_debounced) // Assuming you have a debounced signal
        score <= score + 1;
end

// Increase level based on score or other criteria
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (score >= level * 10) // Example criterion
        level <= level + 1;
end
Button Debouncing
Debouncing is crucial for ensuring that a single physical button press does not register as multiple inputs. Here's a simple debounce logic example:

verilog
Copy code
reg [15:0] debounce_counter = 0;
wire btn_debounced;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (btn == 1'b0)
        debounce_counter <= debounce_counter + 1;
    else
        debounce_counter <= 0;
end

assign btn_debounced = (debounce_counter == 16'hFFFF);
Display and Game Logic Integration
Integrating display logic, input handling, and game mechanics requires careful design, especially managing the timing and synchronization of each component. For instance, updating the mole's position should consider the current level's speed, ensuring the game's difficulty increases as the player advances.

Due to space and complexity, the snippets provided above are simplified and need to be integrated into a cohesive design. Developing a complete game involves considering how each component interacts within the FPGA's constraints, handling edge cases, and optimizing resource usage.
